## 🚦 Step 1: Choose Your Path

### Path A: "I'm a Complete Beginner"

**👉 Go to: [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**

This guide:
- Explains EVERYTHING
- Shows every command
- Has screenshots descriptions
- Assumes you know nothing
- Takes you from zero to deployed

**Print this: [FIRST_TIME_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md](./FIRST_TIME_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)**
- Track your progress
- Check off items as you go
- Don't miss any steps

---

### Path B: "I Know Some Tech Stuff"

**You might be:**
- A developer (but new to this stack)
- Have used Git before
- Comfortable with terminal commands
- Just need the specific steps

**👉 Go to: [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**

But you can:
- Skip sections you know (like "Install Node.js")
- Jump to specific parts
- Use [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for commands

---

## 📋 Before You Begin: Quick Prep

### 1. Clear Your Schedule
- Block out 2.5 hours
- Or do it in chunks (each section = ~30 min)
- Don't rush!

### 2. Get Your Emails Ready
You'll sign up for:
- GitHub
- Vercel
- Supabase
- Cloudinary

**Pro Tip:** Use the same email for all to keep it simple.

### 3. Prepare to Save Passwords
You'll create:
- Database password (Supabase)
- Admin password (for your website)

**Pro Tip:** Use a password manager or write them down safely!

### 4. Have These Ready (Optional but Helpful)
- Your organization's logo (image file)
- Contact photos (if you have them)
- Content text (about, notices, resources)

Don't have these yet? **No problem!** You can add them later through the admin dashboard.
